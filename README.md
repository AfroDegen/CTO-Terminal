# CTO-Terminal
We don’t chase pumps. We front run them. 


## What This Is

CTO Terminal detects Comeback Token Opportunities (CTOs) — dead or ignored pump.fun tokens that are waking back up with fresh liquidity, abnormal volume, and coordinated wallet activity.

It answers one question:

**Is this thing coming back to life right now — or am I already late?**

-----

## Why This Exists

I’ve been manually catching these comebacks for years by watching raw on-chain signals:

- liquidity re-entries
- sudden volume shifts
- wallet clustering

That approach produced consistent results, but it didn’t scale.

CTO Terminal automates the exact signals I already use, so detection happens before price attracts attention.

No narratives. No vibes. Just timing.

-----

## What It Does (V1)

- Monitors pump.fun tokens in real time
- Detects sudden volume spikes (200%+)
- Flags liquidity injections into previously inactive tokens
- Identifies early activity before price expansion
- Sends alerts to Telegram as soon as conditions align

No charts. No dashboards. No fluff.
Just fast signals when something wakes up.

-----

## What It Is Not

- Not a trading bot
- Not financial advice
- Not guaranteed profits
- Not a “post-after-the-pump” alpha group

CTO Terminal is a filter, not a promise.

-----

## Current Status

V1 in active development.

Building in public for pump.fun’s $3M Hackathon.
30 days to ship a working V1 and validate with real users.
